# Frontend component to waveportal 👋

## Usage 🤝

This is based off the Rinkeby network (ETH Testnet)

You will need a wallet to interact with the smart contract, metamask is best

Once you select the candidate you choose to vote for, the website will update immediately once confirmed by ETH (~20 seconds)

## Deployments 💻

Fleek: https://votingdapp.aleemrehmtulla.com

## For development 🧑‍💻

### Scripts

npm start

npm build

npm install


### Important notes

- utils/Voting.json must be updated everytime ABI changes

- Keep contractadress in app.jsx up to date

- Edit app in /src/app.jsx

## Intention, Limitations, and Learnings

This was my second web3, and my first from scracth :)

I could improve by adding forced network changes, emit functions, and better UI. I chose to keep simplicitc for consistent 
growth, making new projects with better features would let me stay excited and be creative 🚀

Learned a ton about solidity here as I implemented everything from scratch, whereas last time was through the buildspace tutorial. I also learned some react concepts in betetr depths like props (scractched props from final), use states, etc.
